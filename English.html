                    <p>We’ve arrived in China, in the wonderful city of Beijing. The journey has been too late. We’re   staying in a hotel near the city, it's very nice!
                        The weather in the city is a bit strange, a moment ago it was very sunny, but then it got cloudy and it started to rain.  
                        We’ve been through the "Let's take care of the pandas!" project, in which we help to keep the pandas' habitat in good condition.
                        We clean the habitat of the pandas, the river and cut the leaves from the trees, we classify the garbage that was collected; we gave them something to eat, well, to tell the truth, too much bamboo. We also checked that the health of all the pandas was fine.
                        Tomorrow we’ll return to the pandas, we’ll feed them again, we’ll put places where they can play and have fun and we’ll bring more pandas to the habitat</p>

                    <p>We arrived safely in Pekin although the flight was a little uncomfortable, since the stop we made in Amsterdam they almost robbed us. The good thing was that we lost the person and went to the airline to got to Pekín. 
                        Whe we arrived in Beijin, the hotel was perfect, they treated us super well, the rooms and bathroom, very clean, and the food tasty, I had never tried a duck in Shangahai. In short, it was worth to say.
                        Me and the group of hunters, and my methodological advisor arrived at the foundation, since we are in charge of killing the deer and fishing the tuna due to exces of habitad, and there is a certain control, and a proportionate ecosystem between pandas, tuna and deer. Once in the park my group of hunter supset used, sine we couldhlt hunt because of our firearms import permit, however we already had it, but they still couldn’t  register us, we did a lot of parper work and it took ta long, mareover, it cast us a lot of money to belong to a hunting club in Pekin. 
                        Once all the hunting paperwork was done, the difficult security guard told us that we had to wait for the person to be able to do our job, even so I contacted my agent and hours later we were able to enter the park.
                        It should be clarified that there was a certain plague of deer, which was a cause of the existence of the pandas, by taking away their own habitat, in fact we hunted a certain number of pieces in 2 weeks, later my methodological advisor carried out the sense of panda tuna and extant deer in the park.
                        In these two weeks that I have been in the park my experience has been favorable, since I have learned a lot about the customs and traditions of China thanks to my guide Mao, in addition my co-workers are doing a good job cleaning the lake, and feeding To the pandas, I'll still have 2 more weeks to make my final hypothesis, but I'm having a great time at work.</p>

                    <p>I am volunteering to help preserve the red pandas in Beijing and it is very nice to work here, I have been cleaning the panda cages, I have also been playing with the pandas and I have been helping in the research of areas to leave.  pandas in good living conditions.  today is the second day that I work and it has gone very well, I met the owners of the panda clinic and it was very nice, they are in beijing and I stayed in a hotel near the center, I did a lot there, I have been living with animals sick or badly injured by scrapes and fractures, I have also been looking at how to treat them and have read a lot about veterinary medicine.  The weather in Beijing was very warm and at first I decided to wear spring clothes to go to work to "live save the pandas". Without a doubt, it was very incredible to work, today on my last day is the best thing I have experienced this year.  We plan to go next week to check out the fruits of our labor, visit the vet, and visit the nearby lake.  see you later!!</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone, we've arrived in China las Saturday. The journey was disappointing 'cause we've bought tickets for first class but in the plane the food was very little and simple and the seat was unconfortble. But  the journey was short. We are staying at a hotel in Pekin. We are here 'cause we are volunteers of a foundation named "Bamboo foundation" and his purpose is protect the panda bears.
                    We've done many things. Some of those are: given food to Pandas, made houses of bamboo, worked as vet's, met the personal of the foundation, and another funny activities.
